`handlery` (like [`emittery`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/emittery) but for 'handle') is a minimal way to handle events with nice class decorators. It works with all kinds of event emitters (emittery, nodejs' `EventEmitter`...) out of the box! So instead of writing

```ts
function registerUserHandlers() {
  const addListener = emitter.on('user.add', (user: UserAddEvent) => {
    // ...
  });

  return () => {
    addListener.unsubscribe();
  };

  // ...
}

const unsubscribeUsers = registerUserHandlers();
```

you can simply do

```ts
@subscribe()
class UserHandler extends EventHandler {
  @on('user.add')
  public handleAddUser(user: UserAddEvent, ctx: HandlerContext) {
    // ...
  }
}
```
